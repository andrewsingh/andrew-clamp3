# Data Processing Overview

The `processing/` folder contains scripts and utilities for converting and processing musical data in different formats. These scripts are divided into three categories: **ABC notation**, **Audio**, and **MIDI**. Each category has its own folder with scripts designed to handle the specific format.

## Folder Structure:
- **`abc/`**: Contains scripts for processing ABC notation files, including converting from and to MusicXML.
- **`audio/`**: Contains scripts for extracting features from audio files, using MERT for audio feature extraction.
- **`midi/`**: Contains scripts for converting MIDI files into other formats, including MTF (MIDI Text Format).

For more detailed instructions on using each script, refer to the individual README files in the respective subfolders.
